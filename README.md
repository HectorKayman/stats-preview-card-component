## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I had the opportunity to learn and apply several key concepts:

- **Semantic HTML Markup**: I reinforced my knowledge of semantic HTML5 markup. I utilized appropriate HTML elements like `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<h1>` to structure the content logically, making it more accessible and SEO-friendly.

- **Responsive Design**: I gained experience in creating a responsive web design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. This project allowed me to practice a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the card component looks appealing on both small and large screens.

- **CSS Flexbox**: I improved my understanding of CSS Flexbox for layout design. I utilized flex containers and flex items to create a two-column layout within the main content container. This approach helped achieve a responsive and visually pleasing design.

- **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)**: I leveraged CSS custom properties (variables) to define and reuse design-related values, such as fonts, colors, and font sizes. This approach improved code maintainability and made it easier to update styles consistently throughout the project.

- **Mix-blend-mode**: I explored the use of the mix-blend-mode property to create a color overlay effect on an image. This technique allowed me to add an appealing visual element to the right column, enhancing the overall design.

### Continued development

As I continue to develop my frontend skills, I plan to focus on the following areas for improvement and exploration:

- **CSS Grid**: While this project primarily utilized CSS Flexbox for layout, I intend to delve into CSS Grid as well. Learning how to combine Flexbox and Grid effectively will provide more layout possibilities and enhance my overall CSS proficiency.

- **Accessibility**: I want to prioritize web accessibility in my projects by ensuring that the code meets accessibility standards. This includes using appropriate ARIA roles, alt text for images, and keyboard navigation.

- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: I will continue to focus on ensuring that my projects are compatible with various web browsers. This includes testing and addressing any compatibility issues that may arise.

- **Responsive Images**: Exploring responsive image techniques, such as using srcset and sizes attributes, will be a part of my ongoing development. This will optimize image loading for different screen sizes and resolutions.

- **Code Optimization**: I will work on optimizing my code for performance and maintainability. This includes minimizing file sizes, reducing unnecessary code, and adhering to best practices.
